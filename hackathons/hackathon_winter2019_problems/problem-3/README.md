# Finding a Motif in DNA

## Problem 

Given two strings s and t, t is a substring of s if t is contained as a contiguous collection of symbols in s (as a result, t must be no longer than s).

Find all locations of t as a substring of s.

__Given__: Two DNA strings s and t (each of length at most 1 kbp).

__Return__: All locations of t as a substring of s.
